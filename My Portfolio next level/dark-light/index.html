            <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
            <pre>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
            readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
            using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
            of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
            making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
            default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
            many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
            over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
            (injected humour and the like).
